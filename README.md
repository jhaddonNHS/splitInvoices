# Invoice spliter
You'll need to install Python3 to use this. You'll then need to install the PyMuPDF module like this:

python -m pip install PyMuPDF

## Usage 
When running the script, it will find any PDFs in the current directory, split them, then output them to a 'Results' folder (the script will create the folder if it doesn't exist).
